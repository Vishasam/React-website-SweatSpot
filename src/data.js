        question: "How often should I exercise?",
        answer: "It could be 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. You can spread your activity out during the week and break it up into smaller chunks of time. It can make life better. "
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        question: "What time of day is best to work out?",
        answer: "working out at 7 a.m., compared to later in the afternoon or evening, may help individuals get more quality sleep at night. One more argument making the case for a workout first thing in the morning is that exercising on an empty stomach could burn more fat."
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        question: "How long should my workouts be?",
        answer: "A 45-minute workout is enough for most people to warm up, do some lifting or cardio, and cool down. Forty-five minutes is also well within the recommended range of 150-200 minutes of physical activity recommended by most experts for both weight loss and overall health"
    },
    {
        id: 4,
        question: "Do I need to warm up before my workouts?",
        answer: "Warm up properly before exercising to prevent injury and make your workouts more effective. This warm-up routine should take at least 6 minutes. Warm up for longer if you feel the need."
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        question: "Should I do strength training, cardio or both?",
        answer: "If your main goal is weight loss, you want to burn calories and build muscle mass. So, for optimal benefits, you should incorporate both cardio and strength training into your exercise routine"
    },
    {
        id: 6,
        question: "Should I lift weights for strength training?",
        answer: "Weight training is an excellent way to build muscle mass and make your muscles stronger. It can also keep your metabolism chugging, strengthen your bones and joints, improve your muscle tone, help you burn more calories, and keep you healthier as you age."
